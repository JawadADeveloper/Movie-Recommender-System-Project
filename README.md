Movie Recommender System
Project Description
This project is a machine learning-based movie recommender system designed to provide personalized movie suggestions. Leveraging collaborative filtering and content-based techniques, the system predicts user preferences based on their viewing history and similarities between movies.

Features
Collaborative Filtering: Utilizes user ratings to recommend movies similar to those rated highly by users with similar tastes. Content-Based Filtering: Analyzes movie attributes (e.g., genres, actors) to suggest movies similar to those a user has liked. Hybrid Approach: Combines both collaborative and content-based methods for enhanced recommendation accuracy.

Technologies
Python
Scikit-Learn
Pandas
NumPy
Surprise (for collaborative filtering)
Streamlit (for web application, if applicable)
Usage
Run the main script to train the model and generate recommendations. For a web-based interface, start the Flask server with python app.py.
